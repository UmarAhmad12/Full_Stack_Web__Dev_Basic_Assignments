Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Ans -> Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning or convey the purpose and 
structure of the content within the tags. These tags provide a way to describe the different 
sections and elements of a web page in a more meaningful and understandable manner.

Some examples of semantic tags introduced in HTML5 include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, 
`<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and many more. 
These tags help to define the purpose and role of different parts of a web page.

Here are a few reasons why semantic tags are important:

1. **Accessibility:** Semantic tags improve accessibility by providing a more descriptive 
structure to web pages. Screen readers and assistive technologies can better 
understand the content and provide a more meaningful experience to users with disabilities.

2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Search engines can better understand the structure 
and content of a web page when semantic tags are used. This can positively impact 
search engine rankings and improve the visibility of the page in search results.

3. **Code Readability and Maintainability:** Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable 
and understandable for developers. By using tags that reflect the purpose of the content, 
it becomes easier to navigate and maintain the codebase, especially in larger projects.

4. **Separation of Structure and Presentation:** Semantic tags promote a clear separation 
of structure and presentation in web development. By using semantic tags, you focus on 
structuring the content, while CSS is used for presentation and styling. 
This separation enhances code modularity and makes it easier to update the 
visual aspects of the website.

5. **Future-proofing:** Semantic tags provide a standardized way of representing content. 
This allows for easier adoption of new technologies and future enhancements to HTML. 
It ensures that your web pages will continue to be interpreted correctly by 
modern browsers and devices.

Overall, semantic tags enhance the semantics and meaning of HTML documents, improving 
accessibility, search engine optimization, code maintainability, and future compatibility. 
They contribute to a better web experience for both humans and machines.
